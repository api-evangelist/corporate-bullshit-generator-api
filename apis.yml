  The Corporate Bullshit Generator is a tool designed to generate random
  nonsensical corporate jargon and buzzwords. It takes mundane phrases and spins
  them into convoluted, meaningless statements that mimic the confusing language
  often used in corporate settings. Users can input their own phrases or let the
  generator create endless strings of gibberish, providing a humorous and
  satirical commentary on the absurdity of corporate communication. It serves as
  a reminder to cut through the noise and focus on clear, concise communication
  in the workplace.
